# MCheyne-Daily-Bread-SWORD
Daily Devotional module for SWORD based Bible Software.

Source and config files for MCheyne's Bible Reading Calendar.

These files were used for **version 1.4** of the **MCheyne** module hosted in the **Xiphos** repository.

This update is the first one that uses **OSIS** syntax for the Scripture reference links.

Use the SWORD utility **imp2ld** to build the module from source file **mcheyne.imp.txt**

The configuration file is **mcheyne.conf**

The original calendar was published in 1842 and is **Public Domain**.

This digital rendering for SWORD applications does not change its copyright status.
